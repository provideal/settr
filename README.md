Settr
=====

Settr is a hierarchical key-value based storage for configuration settings in Rails apps.

WARNING: Under heavy development: I think I should write that this gem is not yet production ready. 
So you should probably wait a bit if you want to use that.

Usage
-----

rake settr_engine:install:migrations
raek db:migration
